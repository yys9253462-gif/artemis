"""The canonical device-action manifest: every dialect of every action, side by side.

Historically each device action was declared independently at three model-facing
sites -- the Operator's inline LangChain shells, the Validator/Flash
``ToolDeclaration`` constants, and the action MCP server's function signatures -- and
the declarations drifted apart (``click.target`` took an element index in one place
and only coordinates in another). This module is now the single place all three are
*defined*; the historical sites import their surface from here, generated.

An action has one agent-facing dialect and one wire dialect:

* ``operator`` -- the agent dialect. Both profiles receive the same indexed
  "Visible UI Elements" list, so target parameters accept ``int`` element indices
  as well as normalized coordinates. The Pro Operator binds it as a LangChain shell
  (declaration-only, "Action Recorded": the Operator's translate step lowers the
  call into structured decisions); the FlashRunner binds the very same description
  and parameters projected onto a JSON ``ToolDeclaration`` (:func:`tool_declaration`),
  and ``McpActionExecutor`` resolves an index against the current element list.
  One definition, two bindings: the two profiles can no longer drift apart.
* ``declaration`` -- a JSON-only agent dialect, used solely for actions that have
  no operator shell (``click_sequence`` is declared to Flash alone).
* ``wire`` -- what the action MCP server serves, mirroring the actuator protocol
  one-to-one: normalized coordinates, millisecond durations, no addressing sugar.
  The client-side executor (``McpActionExecutor``) lowers the agent dialect onto it.

A coordinate target names nothing by itself, so the agent dialect pairs it with
``target_description`` (``target_descriptions`` for a ``click_sequence``): the
model's own statement of what it is aiming at. It is required whenever the target
is a coordinate, recorded verbatim on the action, and never sent to the wire. An
element index needs none -- its text, bounds and id are read from the indexed
list -- and the recorded fields stay separate (``target_text``/``target_bounds``/...
for observed elements, ``target_description`` for described coordinates) so no
reader can mistake the model's belief for an observation.

``tests/unit/mcp/test_action_specs.py`` pins the generated schema of every model
surface and checks that the Flash declaration of each shared action is exactly the
operator shell's schema, so a divergence between what one profile sees and what the
other sees -- the historical definition of drift -- fails CI instead of shipping.

The classification of actions (required/optional/internal) stays in
``action_manifest``; this module holds their schemas and teaching text.
