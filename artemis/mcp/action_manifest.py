"""Contract layer between actuator backends and the agent-facing tool surface.

This module is the single place that declares *what a backend must provide*. It sits
between the actuator implementations (``artemis/mcp/actuators/``) and the agents that
consume tools, so that a backend -- ADB today, a robot arm tomorrow -- can omit tools
it cannot perform, and add tools nobody anticipated, without any agent knowing.

Two rules govern the split between required and optional:

1. A tool is REQUIRED only when a prompt depends on it *structurally*, i.e. the prompt
   cannot be assembled around its absence. Today that is ``click_sequence`` alone: the
   Flash runner prompt's "Time-Sensitive Tasks" teaching is built around "atomic
   chained execution to defeat turn latency", which *is* ``click_sequence``. (The Pro
   Operator needs no such tool: a multi-action turn is executed by the Validator as an
   unvetted fast-action burst.)
2. Everything else is OPTIONAL, because every other prompt reference lives in a tool
   enumeration slot or a self-contained instruction block that the assembly layer
   (``artemis/agents/prompt_assembly.py``) renders conditionally. An optional tool that
   a backend does not implement disappears from the declarations *and* from the prompt,
   so it costs the model nothing.

``tests/unit/mcp/test_action_manifest.py`` re-derives rule 2 by scanning the prompt
sources, so adding a tool name to a prompt without classifying it here fails CI.

#: trivially provide ``click`` as well; ``click`` is nonetheless optional because no
#: prompt depends on it structurally once the enumeration slots are assembled.

        # a ToolDeclaration, i.e. it has always been unreachable by any LLM.

#: loop-termination sentinels. They are unaffected by which actuator is installed.
#:
#: ``run_adb_command`` and ``manage_app`` ride the *system channel* rather than physical
#: actuation: a robot arm driving a handset still has ADB attached, so ``am start``
#: suffices and no icon-hunting is required. (``manage_app`` is nonetheless classified
#: as an optional device action above, since it is declared through the same path.)
