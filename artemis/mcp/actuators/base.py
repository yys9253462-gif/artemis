"""The actuator protocol: what any backend must look like to drive a device.

An actuator answers exactly one question -- *how to perform a physical action* -- in
the canonical 0-1000 normalized coordinate space. It knows nothing about LangGraph
``State``, prompts, agents, screenshots-as-observations, or MCP. Pixel geometry (or a
robot arm's motion planning) is a private detail behind this boundary.

A backend advertises what it can do through :meth:`Actuator.capabilities` (names from
``artemis.mcp.action_manifest.DEVICE_ACTIONS``) and may contribute tools nobody
anticipated through :meth:`Actuator.extensions`. ``validate_actuator`` in the manifest
enforces the contract at session start.

Methods for actions a backend does not implement should simply not exist (or raise
``NotImplementedError``); callers consult ``capabilities()`` first.
